/usr/bin/g++
```

you will need to install it.

For RHEL-based distros, run `sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++`.

For Debian-based distros, run `sudo apt install gcc g++`.

For Arch-based distros, run `sudo pacman -S gcc`.

### Windows

You'll need to install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) and [add it to your PATH](http://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/).

### Mac
